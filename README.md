# QuickFix
QuickFix app for MacOS (Requires Pashua.app for GUI)

Quickfix is a Bash script that leverages Jamf Self Service as its delivery method and Pashua.app (by BlueM) for its UI.
Once Pashua is installed this script can be run as a Jamf policy from Self Service or stand alone.
The Network section is specific to Cisco Anyconnect VPN Client and a Palo Alto firewall using User Auth. You will need to edit these functions to suit your enviroment.

You can get Pashua here:
